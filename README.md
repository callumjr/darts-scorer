## GAME

A darts scorer is an app used for keeping your darts score when playing darts games such as 101, 301 and 501.

You get three darts on each throw and the aim of the game is to get down to 0.

Find darts rules here https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/darts-rules.htm

Enter your score (sum of three darts) and click yes to add score.

The bust button is for when your score is greater than the score you have left.

The app will give you your stats (no of darts and average for three darts).

## CODE

I tried to think functionally when making this app after being introduced to the functional programming paradigm. This was challenging at times trying to keep functions pure and not being able to rely on global variables. I liked the idea of non mutable data using higher order functions such as .map, .filter and .reduce. I have learnt alot while making this project and although i prefer organising my code in other ways thinking functionally has given me techniques i can use in the future to solve problems in best practice such as recursion, closures, currying and function composition. 

I did like the fact that my code was easier to debug but did not like the ammount of extra code which i feel at times was just uneeded. In the end i focused on getting the project done rather than keeping functions completely pure. The project did not need to be perfect in my eyes just practice in the functional programming paradigm.
